# Simple-Sentence-Type-Validator-By-Interpret-Arc by Natnael Abebe Section 03
*I choose Interpreter Architecture Pattern. This pattern is used for designing a component that interprets programs written in a dedicated language.
 It mainly specifies how to evaluate lines of programs, known as sentences or expressions written in a particular language.
 It contains one interface (in my case Interpreter.java) to interpret the context given and a class which implements this interface (in my case GrammerChecker.java).

*In this simple console app, I try to check whether a given sentence (let's consider like it is program statement) by user is correct or not regarding first letter capitalization and full stop end.
 To do this, I use two functions one for each.

*If you have any comment or suggestion ,you contact me by natnaelabebe1990@gmail.com
